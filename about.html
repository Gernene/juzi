  Hello! I'm Juzi, also known as Orange. I am the thousand-year-old fruit of a millenia-old heavenly tree. I have traveled long and far across the mortal realm collecting fables, histories, and other cultural artifacts. Humans amuse me. They are very entertaining.
</p>
<p>
  When not writing, I am usually busy overseeing my celestial enterprise which supplies the heavenly court with fruit juice, fruit snacks, and smoothies&mdash;usually of the orange variety.
