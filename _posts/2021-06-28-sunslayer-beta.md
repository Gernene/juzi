> A prince grapples with mysterious powers while thwarting his brother's mischief. Can they repair their crumbling empire before a vengeful healer destroys it?

> Sun Slayer is a fantasy novel inspired by eastern history and culture. Enter a world of demons, clashing kingdoms, and powerful magic anyone can cultivate... at a very heavy price.

Fans of epic fantasy and eastern martial arts fiction, you have been summoned! Kingdoms are warring, volcanoes are exploding, and my latest draft of [Sun Slayer]({{ site.url}}/sunslayer) needs _your_ expertise! I'm planning to onboard beta readers around November this year, when we shall wage war against weak characterization and bonkers plot points. [Fill out my interest form](https://forms.gle/x5s5uoXsDEkep78C8) to join the fight!

## Why Read Sun Slayer
While Sun Slayer still needs a lot of work, I'm doing my best to give readers a story with:
- High stakes political intrigue
- Nuanced characterization and conflict
- Fast-paced action
- Well-established magic system (wuxia/xianxia cultivation)... with a twist
- Eastern-inspired world deviates from actual history to maintain novelty and suspense

## How It Works
I'm currently editing Sun Slayer for worldbuilding and prose so future beta readers receive my best work. In November, I will reach out to everyone who expressed interest and send them the latest manuscript! 

I am looking for general feedback on plot, characterization and structure as opposed to grammar/line editing:
- Are my characters interesting and act according to clear motivations?
- Can you suspend your disbelief?
- Is the story engaging?

Essentially, I want to make sure the story has a strong foundation before I give everything a shiny coat!

Think Sun Slayer suits your taste? Are you a fellow author who would like me to review your manuscript?
