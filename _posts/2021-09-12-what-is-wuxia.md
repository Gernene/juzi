# What is Wuxia?

*To oversimplify, wuxia is a fiction genre which combines ancient China, epic heroism, and kung fu on steroids.* The name wuxia consists of the Chinese characters 武 (wu) which means “martial” and 侠 (xia) which means “chivalrous”. Wuxia has ancient origins and remains a driving influence in East Asian literature, cinema, television, and visual arts.

Wuxia stories revolve around the lives of martial artists or “cultivators”. They often contain tropes such as:
- FIghting oppressive regimes
- Becoming the greatest martial artist
- Feuding martial arts schools/sects with their own specialized fighting style

Authors may combine wuxia with other genres such as historical fiction and romance, creating a diverse array of stories which appeal to different audiences.

## What is Qi?
The concept of qi (气), an ever-present energy in all things, is integral to traditional Chinese thought. Traditional Chinese medicine, geomancy (fengshui) principles, and of course, Chinese martial arts fiction all rely heavily on this idea. Through meditation and physical training, wuxia cultivators learn to control their innate qi and sometimes, that of others and their surroundings. Command of qi allows cultivators to exercise superhuman abilities such as:
- Enhanced strength, speed, and endurance
- Gravity-defying leaps and flips
- Expelling poison/alcohol through the feet

## The Martial World: Jianghu & Wulin
Jianghu (江湖) and wulin (武林) are two terms you may encounter frequently in wuxia stories. In general, jianghu, which translates directly to "rivers and lakes", refers to the entire martial world&mdash;including its distinctive physical setting. Wulin, which translates to "martial forest", refers to a specific people: all jianghu's martial artists as a collective.

## Sibling Genres: Xianxia & Xuanhuan
Wuxia is often confused with two other fantasy genres: xianxia and xuanhuan. While these genres tend to share emphasis on Chinese martial arts and an eastern setting, they are separated by subtle nuances. Wuxia is just one of many genres within the larger umbrella of Chinese fantasy. However, understanding this genre's basic concepts opens a door to all sorts of eastern fiction.

To the uninitiated: Welcome to jianghu!
