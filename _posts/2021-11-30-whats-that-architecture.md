# What is That Called? Eastern Architecture Terminology
Have you ever tried describing an eastern scene/setting only to realize you don't know what anything is called? You may have seen tens of historical films, television shows, or graphic novels, but you might lack the vocabulary to verbalize what your eyes are already familiar with. Eastern architecture gives eastern fantasy and historical works a very distinct character. It's important to discuss and share these ideas, but we can't do that if we don't know how to talk about them. Today, we're starting with the basics. Here are just a handful of eastern architecutral icons and common English terms used to describe them.

## Pagoda

These towers with multiple, stacked eves are generally used for religious purposes. They are a staple of many visual representations of ancient East Asian cities.

## Eaves & Roof charms

Eastern eaves are the sloped overhangs signature to roofs in eastern architecture. Roofs may also be decorated with "roof charms", statues which often depict mythological creatures.

## Pavilion

Pavilions are common settings in Asian historical novels, films, and TV shows. These are generally open decks sheltered beneath a roof. When viewed from above, the roof will usually form the shape of a circle, square, hexagon, or octagon. Pavillions are often found in gardens or suspended above ponds/lakes. Here, characters may admire beautiful scenery, play music, or converse with other over a cup of tea.

## Terraces

Eastern buildings, especially those found in palaces, often rest atop stacked platforms described as terraces. The Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing's Forbidden City sits on an iconic stack of three marble terraces with railings. The railings are decorated with cylindrical post toppers which, on closer inspection, are covered in dragon engravings. Water spouts shaped like dragon heads line the terrace sides to drain water away from the building.

## Gate tower

Cue the mandatory pan of the city gates. As viewers gaze at the top of the walls, they'll find a traditional Asian building resting above the doors. This is the eastern gate tower, the place where commanders stand as invaders rush the city walls and an icon of eastern historical cinema.
