If your favorite characters were chocolates, what would they be?
<!--more-->

Introducing a fun new way to talk about your favorite books, characters, and chocolate! The Juzi Chocolate Scale was developed as a measure to help readers find the perfect books for them based on their prefered levels of "darkness". Now you never have to worry about confusing terms like "grimdark" and "noblebright". 70% cacao is easy to understand!

My personal interpretation:  
Just Milk = "Does such an angel even exist?"  
White Chocolate = "This is a really good person."  
Milk Chocolate = "Your average human. Might have some skeletons in their closet but is probably not a serial killer."  
Dark Chocolate = "This guy is a serial killer."  
100% Cacao = "This guy is a serial killer and also eats puppies for breakfast."
