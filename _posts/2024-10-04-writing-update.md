Pleased to announce that I have finished a very rough first draft for my latest book (OI). OI is a story of an old, fallen dragon god who emerges from retirement to train the next generation.

The first draft currently sits at about 50k words. As an underwriter, my first drafts tend to be very bare bones. I'll be taking a short reading break to focus on brainstorming details for the setting and characters before starting on draft 2. Draft 2 will focus on integrating these details, fleshing out scenes, adding transitions, and ensuring continuity. Stay tuned, cultivators!
