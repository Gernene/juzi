Hello, I am Juzi, your friendly neighborhood orange. I use this space to chronicle my adventures in the mortal realm while ensuring that everyone stays up-to-date on my latest goods: orange juice and fantasy books.

As I prepare to launch my debut novel (Sun Slayer) sometime this year, I have been drafting a second project: a creation myth set in the same fictional world. This books is shaping up to be very different in tone from Sun Slayer and much shorter in total word count. However, I've truly been enjoying the processs and hope you'll enjoy spending time with the characters as much as I do.

I'm off to write and make myself a lemon smoothie. Enjoy your day!
