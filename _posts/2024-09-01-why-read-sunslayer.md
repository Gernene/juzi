A biased but honest discussion about my lastest fantasy novel Sun Slayer, what you can expect, and what kind of reader would enjoy it the most.
<!--more-->

Greetings, fellow cultivator!

I originally released this piece on one of my social media accounts but decided to share it here to pique interest in my new cultivation manual (eastern fantasy novel). I planned to make two separate posts about this topic, but I realized that many of the reasons one reader might hate Sun Slayer could be the exact same reasons another loves it. Let's dive into a few of the Sun Slayer's defining features which could determine whether or not the book is for you.

## 1. Multiple POV  
I personally consider this to be one of my book's most compelling features. Sun Slayer is a classic wuxia/xianxia-style story told from the perspective of the villain's son. You get to experience the story from different sides, including that of the antagonist. However, I completely understand why this might put some readers off especially if you don't like certain characters&mdash;which brings me to my next point.

## 2. Morally gray and villainous characters  
I'm getting a sense that some readers are tiring of this trope, but as a writer, I never get sick of exploring what happens when normal people are forced to make difficult decisions. There are "sunshine" characters in Sun Slayer, but also a lot of characters who choose to do terrible things.

## 3. Unconventional timeline and structure  
Sun Slayer spans about 20-30 years of history with a considerable timeskip about a third of the way through. The main cast is introduced as children, but by the end of the novel, many of them are in their 30s. You might find it hard to relate to the characters at different points in the book because they transition from the typical YA age range to adults. The change might be pretty jarring, but I also think some readers will enjoy getting to see the characters develop and grow throughout the book.

## 4. Soft emotion-based magic  
I write in a genre where many readers appreciate a relatively hard magic system. (Cultivation novels, anyone?) It's not uncommon for authors to have detailed stages or rankings which unlock specific abilities that are associated with points or numerical power levels and have fancy names for moves and blow-by-blow fight descriptions. I've never managed to get into that kind of writing style as a reader, and I think it definitely shows in my own work. What Sun Slayer has instead is a softer magic system where cultivators' power is bound to a specific feeling or emotion. Depending on which emotion this is, you will face different advantages, disadvantages, and consequences for using your power. The system is meant to feel intuitive while also providing the reader insight into the mental state of the characters.

## 5. The Concept/Premise  
Sun Slayer, at its core, is a story about a prince's relationship with his past and younger self. It's a story about a group of friends torn apart by the same factionalism which is slowly dividing the kingdom they inhabit. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, give this book a pass.

But if what I've shared thus far seems enticing, I'd love for you to pick up a copy of Sun Slayer which is [available both in print and ebook on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDKPHRK7), free on Kindle Unlimited.
