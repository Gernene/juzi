# Comparing Eastern Fantasy Genres: Wuxia VS Xianxia VS Xuanhuan

Wuxia, xianxia, and xuanhuan are three overlapping eastern fantasy genres which incorporate a traditional eastern atmosphere and martial arts elements. While they may appear similar on the surface, (often subtle) differences distinguish each genre and appeal to different audiences.

## Wuxia
Wuxia stories are set in ancient China and may incorporate real historical events/figures. Characters may have superhuman martial arts abilities, but magic and fantastical elements are otherwise limited. Wuxia stories feature mortal, human characters who aren’t pursuing immortality. Think “low fantasy” or “magical realism”.

## Xianxia
Xianxia is basically wuxia with added fantastical elements and concepts from Taoism and Buddhism. The genre features elements like gods, demons, and immortals. Characters are often in the process of cultivating immortality. Some of them may be hundreds if not thousands of years old.

## Xuanhuan
Unlike wuxia and xianxia, xuanhuan stories are not set in ancient China. Rather, they take place in fictional worlds but still preserve a distinct eastern flavor. Xuanhuan stories may incorporate elements from other literary genres and non-east-asian cultures. You might see a “Chinese” cultivator in a European-esque setting, wielding a mechanized weapon.
